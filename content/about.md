# My Professional Background

I obtained a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick in 2013, my thesis title was *"Uncertainty in Changepoints in Time Series"* [^1]. I’m delighted that Dr Little Alex Horne recently became associated with my alma mater through the Taskmaster Education.

[^1]: I'm sure you eager readers can find my thesis online and be gently amused by my chapter quotes.

I have 10 years of industry experience as a Research Scientist/Data Scientist at Amazon and Samsung, predominantly demand forecasting at scale for products. I can impart best practices and vision of how to run this project at scale and with rigor (automation, repeatability).

# My Personal Motivation

There are a variety of personal reasons why I am starting *"The Median Duck"*.

Perhaps optimistically, I want to (stealthy) educate others of analytics to the general public in a fun and amusing manner. Statistics is not taught particularly well in the UK, often seen as a boring number crunching and often a medium to lie. Add to this, I want to instill best practices and the graft work that I have experienced over my years, and that are often overlooked in courses and textbooks (importance of good quality data, automated workflows, etc.).

I made the somewhat brave decision to become self employed at the start of 2024, and have various ventures in the work to provide some income and keep me entertained on a daily basis (piano teaching, piano performance, admin for my housing association). The Median Duck is one of these ventures. I don’t expect this venture to be a major money maker, but I do want to retain my engagement in the data science and statistics field. Add to this, my “imposter syndrome” often wants me to relearn the basics.

I do have some aspirations to potentially go into data journalism through data science and analytics and this venture may provide some experience.

Finally, I do not claim to be a full expert and entirely knowledgeable about the analysis I will be covering. However I’m always eager to learn new topics and also educate others; I believe I am an educator and teacher at my core. My passion for Taskmaster and prior experience with the analytics field thus makes *"The Median Duck"* this the ideal vehicle.

# My Taskmaster History

I properly encountered Taskmaster during 2020 (and the global pandemic), when the Series 2 task “order something without using certain words” was recommended to me on YouTube. Once I watched this task, I was hooked and consequently went down the Taskmaster rabbit hole.

However, I was initially quite dismissive of Taskmaster prior to this. I had previously associated “Taskmaster” with “Ticketmaster” and thus erroneously thought it was going to be a dull show in which extortionate ticket scalping may occur. How wrong I was...

Since 2020, I have watched each series of Taskmaster (mainly UK) near the time of broadcast, and consumed Taskmaster adjacent material (the podcast, comedians appearances on other shows etc.). I have also unofficially (and jokingly) assigned myself the title of *"Taskmaster Representative of the Pacific Northwest"* as I have referred numerous friends and colleagues about Taskmaster and also informed them of when the next series is broadcasting.

# These are a few of my favourite things...
-  **Favourite Task:** Ringtone Choreography (S4E4)
-  **Favourite Series:** Series 4 or 5.
-  **Favourite Contestant:** Victoria Coren Mitchell; I actively squealed when she was announced.
-  **Favourite Quote(s):** "Friendship is Truth"
-  **Degrees of Separation to Alex Horne (to my knowledge):** 3
