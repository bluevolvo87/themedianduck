<p>Welcome to The Median Duck, a self initiated project that aims to
educate and entertain the general public on data analytic topics through
the hit UK TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskmaster_(TV_series)">Taskmaster</a>.</p>
<p>This project is in its early stages, but great things are planned; see
this <a href="vision">vision document</a> for the ambitious plans that I have in mind.</p>
