<h1>The Observed Reality Timeline Approach (ORT)</h1>
<p>A first approach, and most naive logical way to estimate the probabilities is to base it off of the <em>observed</em> placement of each contestant at the end of each episode. From this, we can count the number of times a contestant has placed in a particular ranking, and normalise with respect to the number of episodes that have transpired so far. We refer to this as the **observed reality timeline (ORT)* method to estiamte the probabilities.That is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\texttt{Estimated Probability of Fatiha placing 1st in an Episode} = \frac{\texttt{Number of time Fatiha places has placed 1st}}{\texttt{Total Number of Episodes Fatiha has participated in.}}  
\]</span></p>
<p>More generally,</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:ort-prob">\[
\texttt{Estimated Probability of Contestant $c$ placing $r$ in an Episode} = \frac{\texttt{Number of time Contestant $c$ places has placed $r$}}{\texttt{Total Number of Episodes Contestant $c$ has participated in.}}  \tag{1}
\]</span></p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:obs-win-placement">1</a> shows these estimated probabilites under the ORT approach using all data up to an including Episode 8 of Series 19. There are no major surprises in the results and insights generated:</p>
<div class="insights">
<ul>
<li>Matthew Baynton has an 50% probability of placing 1st in an episode, which makes sense since he has won 4 out of 8 episodes so far.
<ul>
<li>He also has only placed 3rd or 4th in the remaining episodes 4 epsidoes thus far, and has estimated probabilities of 37.50% and 12.50%.</li>
<li>As he has never placed 2nd or 5th so far in the series, he has an estimated probability of 0% for each of these placements respectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For the other contestants, their probabilities are (unsurprisingly) in line with how they have been performing so far in the series:
<ul>
<li>Fatiha is most likely to place 2nd with 37.50%, and 5th with 25%. The remaining placements are with equal probabilities of 12.50%.</li>
<li>Jason is most likely to place 2nd, 3rd and 4th with 25%, and the remaining 12.50% either in 1st or 5th.</li>
<li>Rosie has placed 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th an equal number of times across the 8 episodes, and thus her estimated probability is 25% on each. She has never placed 4th, and thus has an estimated probability of 0%.</li>
<li>Stevie has placed 3rd 50% of the time and thus has an estimated probability of achieving this placement in an episode. Her remaining placement probabilities are 12.50%.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="do-you-want-me-to-stop-the-clock" class="section level2">
<h2>Do You Want Me To Stop the Clock?</h2>
<p>We have a way of estimating probabilities for a contestants placement in a episode! Job done, stop the clock.</p>
<p>One advantage of the ORT approach is the simplicity and intuitive nature of it. It is grounded in reality as it based on contestant’s placement in each episode that we have observed. Consequently, it is simple to calculate (low computational power) and can be conveyed easily to others.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/9tmBOQ-19LcAAAAd/little-alex-horne-alex-horne.gif" width="25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="the-drawback-of-the-backdraw" class="section level2">
<h2>The Drawback of the Backdraw</h2>
<p>However, one potential drawback of the the ORT approach is that if a contestant has not ended up in a particular place for a episode, we have to assign a probability of 0% of this event occurring.</p>
<p>Whilst this is true from observations we have, it is potentially misleading to assign 0% probability with such definitiveness. It could be that this event has not has not occurred yet (but is stil probable and possible), or is an extrememely rare event (extremely rare is not the same as improbable).</p>
<p>One consequence of this approach is that at the beginning of the series, many of the probabilites will be 0% since we have not observed that particular (contestant, placement ranking) combination. These estimated probabilities are likely not representative of what could occur later in the series.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-multiverse-approach-mv" class="section level1">
<h1>The Multiverse Approach (MV)</h1>
<p>In the spirit of seeming hip, cool and invested in popular culture, it is time to introduce to concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">multiverse</a>, and how we can use this analogy to generate a distribution of probabilities which are more representative of all potential timelines and events.</p>
<p>The ORT is just one realisation of a particular timeline involving the series 19 cast. There are potentially other timelines and alternate universes involving the Series 19 cast in which the contestants performed differently, and the contestant placements are different. These alternative timlines and universes define the multiverse that we operate in.</p>
<p>We can use these alternative timelines and capture more potential outcomes, even if they have yet to be observed (or will ever be). It is these alternative timelines that will also help generate a probability distribution for contestant placement within an episode, which is more informative and potential outcomes of the series. We refer to this method of estimating probabilities as the MultiVerse Approach (MV)</p>
<div id="whats-the-situation" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s the Situation?</h2>
<p>I’ll go into more detail in a later post of how these alternative timelines are simulated, and the generating the probability distribution of contestant placement within an episode. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>The alternative timelines are generated through sampling and simulation based techniques.</li>
<li>Sampling is performed (with replacement) on existing (contestant, task-attempt) data we have observed to date.</li>
<li>Additional logical is then employed to group and re-rank contestants based on these samples.</li>
<li>Once we have simulated these alternative timelines and outcomes, we can then estimate probabilities based on an equation similar to Equation <a href="#eq:ort-prob">(1)</a>.
<ul>
<li>However under MV, we would be considering all alternative timelines we have simulated for both the numerator and denominator, and not just episodes that have brodcasted and observed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In the statistical literature, this approach is based on concepts concerning <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/?s=sampling">sampling</a> (in particular <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/bootstrapping/">Bootstrapping</a>), and <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/probability/monte-carlo-simulation">Monte Carlo simulation</a> methods.</p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:mv-prob-plot">2</a> displays the probabilities under the Multiverse approach. It is based on using observed data up to and including episode 8 of Series 19, using 1000 simulations (that is 1000 alternative episodes were simulated), and random seed<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> 2019 (based on 2025-05-01, the UK broadcast date of Episode 1 of Series 19).</p>
<div class="insights">
<ul>
<li>The MV probability distributions are “complete”: a non-zero probability is assigned to all contestant ranking combinations, even though these have not been realised.</li>
<li>The distributions for each contestant are peaked and skewed to how the contestants are performing in the series overall, and their general task performance:
<ul>
<li>For Fatiha, the distribution is symmetrical and peaked around 3rd place with a probability of 21.80%.</li>
<li>For Jason, the distribution is skewed towards the lower rankings, with 5th place being the most probable outcome with 26.10%.</li>
<li>Matthew’s distribution is skewed towards the higher ranking position, with 1st place being the most probable outcome with 44.10%.
<ul>
<li>The probability of him ranking 5th in an episode is 5.80%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rosie also has distribution skewedwed the higher ranking positions, although not as peaked as Matthew’s. Her most probable position is 2nd place with 26.40%, although her 1st place probability is a close second place with 25.60%.</li>
<li>Stevie has a similar distribution to Jason in that it is skewed towards the lower rankings. She is most likely to rank 5th in an episode with a probability of 25%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The MV distributions are noticeably different to the ORT distributions.
<ul>
<li>This can be see as counter-intuitive in that it differs to the reality we have observed. However, it does make sense given that the MV methodology is based on a generalised performance of a contestant (captured through the simulation of many alternative timelines), whereas the ORT is based on a single realisation. This realisation, could be representative of how a contestant performs in general, or a rarer extreme occurrence (they performed worse).</li>
<li>The ORT distribution can also be misleading due to closes finishes that may occurr, or ties in placements.</li>
<li>The generalised nature of how the MV distributions are generated also makes sense as to why it is aligned with the series ranking, and their general placement within tasks.</li>

<div id="some-considerations" class="section level2">
<h2>Some Considerations</h2>
<p>The MV approach to estimate probability distributions of contestant ranking placements within an episode is by no means perfect. There are still some considerations and assumptions that needed to be expanded upon in the future. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is 1000 alternate timelines (simulations), sufficient in obtaining the probability distribution?
<ul>
<li>Ideally, sufficient simulations have been performed such that the distribution does not drastically between randomness settings</li>
<li>A study of the number of simulations required to achieve a stable distribution is likely a topic for another post.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The proposed MV method does not account for certain Taskmaster idiosyncrancies. For example, we do not distinguish between solo and team tasks. Nor do we account for “5 points to the winner, 0 for everyone else” instances, or <a href="https://taskmaster.info/task.php?id=3520">Series 18’s Joker mechanism</a>.</li>
<li>Greater care and understanding of how ties should be handled.In particular, we do not consider tie breakers when two or more contestants having the highest number of points at the end of the episode. The winner of these tie breakers is officially deemed the winner of the episode (they get to take home the prizes).</li>
