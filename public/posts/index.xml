      <description>I‚Äôm on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impressive,‚Äù he said.&#xA;I was a little surprised, because though I‚Äôve gotten that comment before, it‚Äôs become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description>

      <title>How I Learned to Stop Procrastinating, &amp; Love Letting Go</title>

I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.&#xA;Until I didn‚Äôt. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description>

      <title>Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/posts/post-2/</link>

      <description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.&#xA;We are afraid of empty space in our lives.&#xA;The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.&#xA;We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description>
