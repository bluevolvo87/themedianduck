<div id="my-professional-background" class="section level1">
<h1>My Professional Background</h1>
<p>I obtained a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick in 2013, my thesis title was <em>“Uncertainty in Changepoints in Time Series”</em> <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I’m delighted that Dr Little Alex Horne recently became associated with my alma mater through the <a href="https://taskmastereducation.com/news/dr-little-alex-horne">Taskmaster Education</a> scheme.</p>
<p>I have 10 years of industry experience as a Research Scientist/Data Scientist at Amazon and Samsung, predominantly demand forecasting at scale for products. From this experience, I have some experience on running projects at scale, with rigor (automation, repeatability) and compromises that need to be made (whether it be technical, monetary, mental).</p>
</div>
<div id="my-personal-motivation" class="section level1">
<h1>My Personal Motivation</h1>
<p>There are a variety of personal reasons why I am starting <em>The Median Duck</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps optimistically, I want to (stealthy) educate others of analytics to the general public in a fun and amusing manner. Statistics is not taught particularly well in the UK, often seen as a boring number crunching and often a medium to lie. Add to this, I want to instill best practices and the graft work that I have experienced over my years, and that are often overlooked in courses and textbooks (importance of good quality data, automated workflows, etc.).</p>
<p>I made the somewhat brave decision to become self employed at the start of 2024, and have various ventures in the work to provide some income and keep me entertained on a daily basis (piano teaching, piano performance, admin for my housing association). The Median Duck is one of these ventures.</p>
<p>I don’t expect this venture to be a money maker (major or minor), but I do want to retain my engagement in the data science and statistics field. Add to this, my “imposter syndrome” often wants me to relearn the basics.</p>
<p>I do have some aspirations to potentially go into data journalism through data science and analytics and this venture may provide some experience and build up a portfolio of work.</p>
<p>Finally, I do not claim to be a full expert and entirely knowledgeable about the analysis I will be covering<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. However I’m always eager to learn new topics and also educate others; I believe I am an educator and teacher at my core. My passion for Taskmaster and prior experience with the analytics field thus makes <em>The Median Duck</em> this the ideal vehicle.</p>
</div>
<div id="my-taskmaster-journey" class="section level1">
<h1>My Taskmaster Journey</h1>
<p>My Taskmaster journey properly started during 2020 (and the global pandemic), when the Series 2 task “order something without using certain words” was recommended to me on YouTube. Once I watched this task, I was hooked and consequently went down the Taskmaster rabbit hole and binged whatever series were available.</p>
<p>However, prior to this, I was initially quite dismissive of Taskmaster. I had previously associated “Taskmaster” with “Ticketmaster” and thus erroneously thought it was going to be a dull show in which extortionate ticket scalping would occur. How wrong I was…</p>
<p>Since 2020, I have watched each series of Taskmaster (mainly UK) near the time of broadcast, and consumed Taskmaster adjacent material (the podcast, comedians appearances on other comedy shows etc.).</p>
<p>I have also unofficially (and jokingly) assigned myself the title of <em>“Taskmaster Representative of the Pacific Northwest”</em> as I have referred numerous friends and colleagues about Taskmaster and also informed them of when the next series is broadcasting.</p>
