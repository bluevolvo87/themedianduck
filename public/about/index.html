			<h1 id="my-professional-background">My Professional Background</h1>
<p>I obtained a PhD in Statistics from the University of Warwick in 2013, my thesis title was <em>&ldquo;Uncertainty in Changepoints in Time Series&rdquo;</em> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I’m delighted that Dr Little Alex Horne recently became associated with my alma mater through the Taskmaster Education.</p>
<p>I have 10 years of industry experience as a Research Scientist/Data Scientist at Amazon and Samsung, predominantly demand forecasting at scale for products. I can impart best practices and vision of how to run this project at scale and with rigor (automation, repeatability).</p>
<h1 id="my-personal-motivation">My Personal Motivation</h1>
<p>There are a variety of personal reasons why I am starting <em>&ldquo;The Median Duck&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Perhaps optimistically, I want to (stealthy) educate others of analytics to the general public in a fun and amusing manner. Statistics is not taught particularly well in the UK, often seen as a boring number crunching and often a medium to lie. Add to this, I want to instill best practices and the graft work that I have experienced over my years, and that are often overlooked in courses and textbooks (importance of good quality data, automated workflows, etc.).</p>
<p>I made the somewhat brave decision to become self employed at the start of 2024, and have various ventures in the work to provide some income and keep me entertained on a daily basis (piano teaching, piano performance, admin for my housing association). The Median Duck is one of these ventures. I don’t expect this venture to be a major money maker, but I do want to retain my engagement in the data science and statistics field. Add to this, my “imposter syndrome” often wants me to relearn the basics.</p>
<p>I do have some aspirations to potentially go into data journalism through data science and analytics and this venture may provide some experience.</p>
<p>Finally, I do not claim to be a full expert and entirely knowledgeable about the analysis I will be covering. However I’m always eager to learn new topics and also educate others; I believe I am an educator and teacher at my core. My passion for Taskmaster and prior experience with the analytics field thus makes <em>&ldquo;The Median Duck&rdquo;</em> this the ideal vehicle.</p>
<h1 id="my-taskmaster-history">My Taskmaster History</h1>
<p>I properly encountered Taskmaster during 2020 (and the global pandemic), when the Series 2 task “order something without using certain words” was recommended to me on YouTube. Once I watched this task, I was hooked and consequently went down the Taskmaster rabbit hole.</p>
<p>However, I was initially quite dismissive of Taskmaster prior to this. I had previously associated “Taskmaster” with “Ticketmaster” and thus erroneously thought it was going to be a dull show in which extortionate ticket scalping may occur. How wrong I was&hellip;</p>
<p>Since 2020, I have watched each series of Taskmaster (mainly UK) near the time of broadcast, and consumed Taskmaster adjacent material (the podcast, comedians appearances on other shows etc.). I have also unofficially (and jokingly) assigned myself the title of <em>&ldquo;Taskmaster Representative of the Pacific Northwest&rdquo;</em> as I have referred numerous friends and colleagues about Taskmaster and also informed them of when the next series is broadcasting.</p>
<h1 id="these-are-a-few-of-my-favourite-things">These are a few of my favourite things&hellip;</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favourite Task:</strong> Ringtone Choreography (S4E4)</li>
<li><strong>Favourite Series:</strong> Series 4 or 5.</li>
<li><strong>Favourite Contestant:</strong> Victoria Coren Mitchell; I actively squealed when she was announced.</li>
<li><strong>Favourite Quote(s):</strong> &ldquo;Friendship is Truth&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Degrees of Separation to Alex Horne (to my knowledge):</strong> 3</li>
